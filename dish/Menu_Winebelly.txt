Winebelly - This new South Austin wine and tapas bar was a pleasant find from the same family who owns Vietnamese restaurants, Hai Ky. I originally happened in with a friend to check out the wine list, but was pleasantly surprised by the food menu as well. In addition to tapas such as roasted cauliflower with raisins and anchovy-soaked bread crumbs to tasty grilled lamb ribs with herbed yogurt and vegetables, you'll find an assortment of cheese, charcuterie and savory bar snacks including shishito peppers with fresh ricotta and piquant French fries with pimenton and chili pepper.

I would say it means it isn't expensive, there is plenty of free parking, and you can usually just walk in and get a table. These are the very things that set Winebelly apart from the other tapas bars that have opened recently in Austin; it truly is a neighborhood wine bar. It isn't pricey, with most of the bar snacks costing around $5 each, and the tapas hovering around $10. Every time I have gone in I have been seated immediately, and whether driving or walking, there is none of the hassle that heading Downtown invariably entails. Unsurprisingly, Winebelly has been warmly embraced by area residents."},{"entryId":"84019326","name":"Megan Giller, Zagat.Com","description":"South Austin is already abuzz about the new restaurant from the owners of Hai Ky.
